## Entries

### 2026-09-22 — Initial project scaffolding
- Agent/Model: Claude Sonnet 5
- What: Initialized the git repo; added `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `.agents/LOG.md`, and `.agents/PLAN.md`. No app code written yet.
- Why: Project rules require an LLM-friendly doc index, a git repo, and a plan file before any real feature work begins.
- Commit(s): c9da231

### 2026-09-22 — Plan review
- Agent/Model: Claude Sonnet 5
- What: Reviewed `.agents/PLAN.md` for clarity/completeness; added an "Architecture decisions" section (folder layout, event-bus state/UI-sync pattern, dev-serving note, testing approach) and a "Non-goals / open questions" section (sample recording/import, collaboration, native packaging, hosting all deferred).
- Why: Requested full review before execution; several foundational choices (folder layout, state-sync pattern) were previously undecided and would have caused churn later.
- Commit(s): dc6d678

### 2026-09-22 — Phase 1: skeleton app & audio foundation
- Agent/Model: Claude Sonnet 5
- What: Built `src/` (index.html, css/main.css, js/core/eventBus.js, js/audio/{audioEngine,voice}.js, js/ui/pianoTrigger.js, js/main.js) with companion `.md` files for each; added `.claude/launch.json` (Python static server) for local dev preview. Verified in-browser: `AudioContext` reaches `running` state and produces a routed oscillator voice on note-on, pointer/touch and computer-keyboard input both trigger notes, and the piano layout wraps correctly at mobile width.
- Why: First scoped implementation task per Phase 1 of the plan — proves the audio graph and the event-bus UI/model split end-to-end before building the real synth engine.
- Commit(s): fb56fd1

### 2026-09-22 — Phase 2: MIDI input
- Agent/Model: Claude Sonnet 5
- What: Added `js/midi/midiInput.js` (Web MIDI device enumeration, hot-plug via `onstatechange`, message parsing for note on/off, CC, pitch bend) and `js/ui/midiStatus.js` (connection status readout). Extended the piano-trigger's `note:on`/`note:off` payloads with `velocity`/`source` to match MIDI's shape. Verified in-browser: on the sandboxed preview, `requestMIDIAccess` is permission-denied and the app correctly falls back to an "unavailable" status instead of erroring; UI note input still works unaffected.
- Why: Second scoped task per the plan — unifies hardware MIDI and on-screen/keyboard input behind one event contract before the real synth engine consumes it.
- Commit(s): (pending)
